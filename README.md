# IntellAlign: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Sequence Alignment

## Overview

IntellAlign is a novel methodology for multiple sequence alignment (MSA), 
developed as part of an MSc thesis in Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning by Eirini Kotzia. 
The project employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to address the fundamental task of MSA in Bioinformatics.

## Features
